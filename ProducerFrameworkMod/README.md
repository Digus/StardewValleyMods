## Install
1. [Install the latest version of SMAPI](https://smapi.io/).
2. Install [this mod from Nexus mods](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/4970).
3. Unzip any Producer Framework Mod content packs into `Mods` to install them.
4. Run the game using SMAPI.

## Introduction
### What is Producer Framework Mod?
Producer Framework Mod allows you to add custom machines to the game and to modify the input/output of vanilla machines without having to create a SMAPI mod or altering vanilla files.

I highly recommend looking up preexisting content packs for further examples:

* [Artisan Valley](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/1926) 
* [Artisanal Soda Makers](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/5173)
* [Trents New Animals](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/3634)

### Companion Mods
There are other frameworks out there that pair well with Producer Framework Mod:

 * [PFMAutomate](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/5038) adds support for [Automate](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/1063),
 * [Content Patcher](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/1915).
 * [Json Assets](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/1720) to add custom inputs/outputs and to add the machine sprites..
 * [Mail Framework Mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/1536) to send objects & cooking/crafting recipes.
 * [Custom Cask Mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/2642) to add custom items as valid cask inputs.
 * [Custom Producer Mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/4992) includes a list of all vanilla inputs/outputs.

## Basic Features
### Overview
There are two main files you will see when downloading a content pack.
* producerRules.json
* producersConfig.json

You will also see a `manifest.json` for SMAPI to read (see [content packs](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Modding:SMAPI_APIs#Manifest) on the wiki). These names are case sensitive and will not work on MacOS is the case is changed.

### producerRules
All lines that have a default value can be removed and that value will be used. You can only have one producer rule per input. To have additional outputs you will need to use `AdditionalOutputs`.

The `producerRules.json` can contain these fields:

field                                   | purpose

`SilverQualityInput`                    | _(optional)_ Define an alternative stack if they input is silver quality. Removing will ignore this since probability will be 0. See [Star Quality Inputs](#star-quality-inputs) for more information on the fields it contains.
`GoldQualityInput`                      | _(optional)_ Define an alternative stack if they input is gold quality. Removing will ignore this since probability will be 0. See [Star Quality Inputs](#star-quality-inputs) for more information on the fields it contains.
`IridiumQualityInput`                   | _(optional)_ Define an alternative stack if they input is iridium quality. Removing will ignore this since probability will be 0. See [Star Quality Inputs](#star-quality-inputs) for more information on the fields it contains.
`OutputColorConfig`                     | _(optional)_ If set, the output will be a Colored Object. Remember that colored objects need the next sprite in the sheet to be a pallet for the color. Default is null. See [OutputColorConfig](#outputcolorconfig) for more information on the fields it contains.
`AdditionalOutputs`                     | _(optional)_ Define a list of additional outputs. You don't need to set a default output to use the additional ones, the first additional output will be the default in that case. Only one output is given, randomly chosen between the options. Default is an empty list. See [AdditionalOutputs](#additionaloutputs) for more information on the fields it contains.
`Sounds`                                | List of sound to make when an input is placed. Default is an empty list. A list of sounds can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CpDrw23peQiq-C7F2FjYOMePaYe0Rc9BwQsj3h6sjyo/edit#gid=1007039997).

`PlacingAnimationOffsetX`               | _(optional)_ The offset of the X axis. The offset is relative to the animation default location, not the position of the machine. Default is `0`.
`PlacingAnimationOffsetY`               | _(optional)_ The offset of the Y axis. The offset is relative to the animation default location, not the position of the machine. Default is `0`.
`IncrementStatsOnInput`                 | _(optional)_ Game stats to increment when a input is placed. Will increment the stats by the amount of the stack. Vanilla machines already increment stats when an item is removed from the machine. Only the Recycle Machine increment the stats on input. Default is an empty list.
`OverrideMod`                           | _(optional)_ If defined, this rule can override rules with the same producer/input combination from the mods in the list. Otherwise the first one to be loaded will be used. 
`LookForInputWhenReady`                 | _(optional)_ Set this config if you want to look for a specific object when ready. If the rule has an input, it will consume the input on placement, check restrictions to choose the output, but won't apply name, price, quality and similar modifications based on that input. The found object when ready will be used for these modifications instead. See [LookForInputWhenReady](#lookforinputwhenready) for more information.

#### Star Quality Inputs
Below is more information on the `SilverQualityInput`, `GoldQualityInput`, `IridiumQualityInput` field. 

This "will only apply if the input is exactly that quality. If an specific quality is not set, it will use the default stack for no quality. Same if the probability is not met} [Source](https://forums.nexusmods.com/index.php?/topic/8257593-producer-framework-mod/page-3#entry75988918).

All three utilize the same fields.

field             | purpose
------------------| -------
`Probability`     | Probability to use the alternative stack. Default is 0.
`OutputStack`     | Set the output stack quantity. Default is 1.
`OutputMaxStack`  | Set the max output stack, if you want a random output stack. It'll be ignored if smaller than `OutputStack`. Default is 1.

Example:

```
"SilverQualityInput": { 
      "Probability": 0.2, 
      "OutputStack": 2, 
      "OutputMaxStack": 4 
    },
```

#### OutputColorConfig
Below is more information on the `OutputColorConfig` field. 

field     | purpose
----------| -------
`Type`    | [ObjectColor|ObjectDyeColor|DefinedColor] If `ObjectColor` and the input is a colored object, it will use the color of the input. If `ObjectDyeColor` and the input has a dye color specified in the [context tags](https://github.com/spacechase0/JsonAssets/blob/master/README.md#context-tags), it will use this color. If `DefinedColor` or it does find the color on the other options, it will create the color based on the Red, Green and Blue values. Default is `DefinedColor`.
`Red`     | The red value of the color. Default is 255.
`Green`   | The green value of the color. Default is 255.
`Blue`    | The blue value of the color. Default is 255.

Example:

```
"OutputColorConfig":
        {

The `AdditionalOutputs` may contain the following:

field                            | purpose
---------------------------------| -------
`OutputProbability`              | _(optional)_ The absolute probability of getting that output, from 0 to 1. Default is `0`. If 0 the remain percent not defined will be equally divided between all outputs with 0 probability. Probability are checked from the first to the last output, so with the total is bigger than 1, the remaining outputs will be ignored.
`OutputIdentifier`               | This is required. Works the same as the OutputIdentifier described in the rule.
`MinutesUntilReady`              | The amount of minutes it takes to produce this output. This will override the default MinutesUntilReady set in the rule. Should be divisible by 10.

`RequiredOutdoors`               | _(optional)_ [true|false|null] If true, the output can only be produced outdoors. If false, the output can only be produced indoors. If the line is removed or the value is null, it there is no restriction.
`RequiredInputParentIdentifier`  | Required input parent for the output to be possible. Parent is the item that originated the input.(ex. Salmon Roe has Salmon as parent) The identifier is compared with the input parent on this order: Index, Name, Category, Context_Tag.

Example:

```
"AdditionalOutputs": [ 
      {
        "OutputProbability": 0.2, 
        "OutputIdentifier": "Apple",

      "GardenPot": true, 
      "FruitTree": true, 
      "BigCraftable": false 
    }
```

### producersConfig
A `producersConfig` is not needed if you are only using machines from another mod. It is only needed when new machines are being added. 

Scenarios:
1) You're using the Dehydrator from Artisan Valley. You do not need a `producersConfig`. 

2) You're using the Dehydrator from Artisan Valley and a new machine you made. You need a `producersConfig` entry for the new machine.

3) You're using the vanilla machines. You do not need a `producersConfig`.

### Machine Animations
Below is an excerpt taken from the [Json Assets ReadMe](https://github.com/spacechase0/JsonAssets/blob/master/README.md) regarding machine animations. 

`ReserveExtraIndexCount` is used primarily for big-craftable machines. It may also be useful for a SMPAI mod that utilizes chest animation. Unlike CFR, each frame of the machine will need to be it's own image. Starting with `big-craftble`, `big-craftable-2` `big-craftable-3` and so on. `big-craftable` (no numbers) is considered to be 0 in the index. So for our example of the Alembic, there is the starting frame and then 7 additional frames afterwards for the animation.

Here is a preview of the folder contents
[Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/Du4WNM5.png)

Example:
```
{
    "Name": "Alembic",
    "Description": "Distills flowers, fruits, herbs, and vegetables into essential oils.",
    "Price": 1,
    "ProvidesLight": false,
    "ReserveExtraIndexCount": 7,

If you want an image to constantly animate you will need to use the [Content Patcher API](#content-patcher-api).

<details>
  <summary> <b>Expand for more information on PFM useage </b> </summary>

When using with PFM in the `producersConfig.json` this information would translate to:

```
{
    "ProducerName": "Alembic", 
    "AlternateFrameProducing": false, 
    "AlternateFrameWhenReady": false, 
    "DisableBouncingAnimationWhileWorking": true, // Disables defualt bouncing animation
    "ProducingAnimation": { 
            "RelativeFrameIndex": [1,2,3,4,5,6], //big-craftable-2 through big-craftable-7
            "FrameInterval": 10 
        },
        "ReadyAnimation": 
        {
          "RelativeFrameIndex": [7], // big-craftable-8
      },
  },
```

This is mentioned because JA & PFM indexs are one off of each other. `big-craftable` is your idle animation. `big-craftable-2` through `big-craftable-7` are your `ProducingAnimation` `RelativeFrameIndex`. Finally `big-craftable-8` is your `ReadyAnimation` `RelativeFrameIndex`. You can have less or more than 8 `big-craftable` just keep in mind to bump each number down one.

## FAQ
### Custom Name Already in Use
```
WARN Producer Framework Mod] The custom name 'Ground {inputName}' is already in use for the object with the index '2371'. The custom name '{inputName} Modo(a)' will be ignored.
```

This is a harmless error. It means another pack is using the same translation key. Please see which was is the newer of the two and report the issue to the author. The solution is to either rename the translation key or remove the i18n entry (best if the mods are by the same author/rely on each other to work).
